# BluePill

This project is a mess and it has never been tested.

The goal is to make STM32F103C BluePill compatible PCB with safety resistors, robust power supply with protections and SD card addon using a stacked PCB. The project is designed in [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/) with design rules for [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/) including SMT assembly with their LCSC parts library.

This PCB was never tested or manufactured because the STM32 microcontrollers are out of stock globally.
